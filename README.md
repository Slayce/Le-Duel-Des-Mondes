# The Duel of Universes
Hearthstone-like game made in a team of 7 in Java for a school project.
I was in charge of the software architecture and of the coordination of the different sub-teams of two we created. The sub-team I was in was in charge of the core of the program (package jeu), but I also helped with the GUI one (package ihm).

## Description 
The goal of this school project was to make great use of MVC design pattern using the Java Swing GUI toolkit, and we decided to create a game based on the idea of Heartstone.

The idea is that two different universes fight against each other. By default, there are two universes available : Star Wars and Harry Potter. We created a set of cards with life and attack points for each universe.

The player has 4 mana points for each turn which he can use to put cards from its hands to the board (each card costs a certain amount of mana).
Then, he can choose to attack with the cards on his board either the enemy's hero or their cards.

We only had a few month and much more projects to do so we couldn't finish everything we wanted (ability for the player to create his own deck, possibility to play with a friend on the same computer,...), but we created the architecture with that in mind.  

You will also find that we conducted unit tests on our game using JUnit.
